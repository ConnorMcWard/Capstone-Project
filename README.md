# Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains the capstone projects for the 2023 CSU EB course. The capstone is composed of two distinct data science projects:
1. **Hotel Cancellations**: Predicting hotel reservation cancellations.
2. **Housing Prices**: Predicting house sales prices.

## Hotel Cancellations

### [Hotel Cancellations Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e7/data)

### Description
The Hotel Cancellations project aims to predict which customers are likely to cancel their hotel reservations. The dataset includes various features such as booking lead time, number of special requests, and previous cancellations. Participants are tasked with developing a binary classification model to predict cancellations. The ultimate goal is to enhance the hotel's ability to manage bookings and minimize revenue loss due to cancellations.

## Housing Prices

### [Housing Prices Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

### Description
The Housing Prices project focuses on predicting the sales price of houses based on a variety of features provided in the dataset. These features include the size and condition of the house, neighborhood information, and other relevant factors. Participants are expected to use advanced regression techniques to build a model that accurately predicts the sale prices. This competition is an excellent opportunity to practice feature engineering, data cleaning, and applying regression models.
