# Hotel Cancellations

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict which customers are likely to cancel their hotel reservations. The dataset includes various features such as booking lead time, number of special requests, and previous cancellations. The goal is to build a binary classification model to predict cancellations and help the hotel manage bookings more effectively.

## Dataset
### Source
[Hotel Cancellations Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e7/data)

### Description
The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including:
- **Lead Time**: Number of days between the booking date and the arrival date.
- **Number of Special Requests**: Number of special requests made by the customer.
- **Previous Cancellations**: Number of times the customer has previously canceled bookings.
- And several other features relevant to booking status.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights from the data exploration include:
- Distribution of cancellations across different lead times.
- Relationship between the number of special requests and cancellations.
- Patterns in previous cancellations and their impact on current bookings.

## Data Preprocessing
Steps taken to clean and prepare the data include:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing numerical features.

## Modeling
